        <p style="text-align:left; padding-left: 10px; padding-right:10px; font-size:1.3em;"> We are a group of Physicians who specialize in the Integrative Medicine approach to wellness. Our core principles: We use conventional and alternative methods to facilitate the body’s innate healing response, emphasizing appropriate use of less-invasive and less-harmful interventions whenever possible, while addressing the whole person in addition to disease.  At the forefront of our approach is developing a partnership between the patient and the practitioner. We have a collective 50+ years of trusted medical experience. Our <strong><u>first</u></strong> <strong><u>priority</u></strong> is to provide the very best of care to you and your family.  </p>

    <p style="text-align:left; padding-left: 10px; padding-right:10px; font-size:1.3em;">Many patients are anxious upon visiting a new doctor. Here is a picture of what you can expect on your first visit to our office.  As you enter our office you will be greeted by our friendly staff who will lead you to your own relaxing <strong><u>private</u></strong> <strong><u>room</u></strong> where your basic information will be taken.  You will remain in your private room throughout your visit with us, and all of our medical staff will come to you! While you wait between visits you may relax, read, listen to music, watch TV, have a refreshing drink, all provided in your room. Next, one of our Nurses or Medical Assistants will come and take your vital signs, medical history and document your basic health concerns. Then a Nurse Practitioner will meet with you to dig deeper into your current concerns, and answer any questions you may have about our practice and the field of Integrative Medicine. Finally, your Physician will come to your room to discuss your health concerns, perform an exam, discuss any tests/labs which may be indicated, and work with you to develop your individualized health care plan that best suits your wants and needs.  </p>
